## ☣️ The Situation
A Class-5 Zombie Outbreak has breached containment in Providence and is spreading rapidly across the state of Rhode Island. Traditional containment has failed. 

**Your Mission:** As a recruit of the Data Response Team, you must use MATLAB to track infection vectors, manage dwindling hospital supplies, and model the long-term spread before the state is overrun.

This repository contains the **Source Code** and **Mission Files** for the "Introduction to MATLAB" workshop. These are the template files. You must fill in the details using the slides to complete the tutorial.

## 🚀 Usage Protocols (How to Run)

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/cyclotomicextension/operation-ocean-state.git](https://github.com/cyclotomicextension/operation-ocean-state.git)
    ```
    *(Or simply download the ZIP file).*

2.  **Launch MATLAB:**
    Open MATLAB (Version R2020b or later recommended).

3.  **Execute Phase 1:**
    Open `phase1.m` and click **Run**. Follow the instructions in the command window.

4.  **Proceed in Order:**
    The skills build upon each other. Do not skip phases, or you *will* be eaten.
